# Downfall

**Game Jam Project â€“ Theme: Constant Descent**  
Developed for the [Sky Game Jam 2025] in Godot.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Concept

A fast-paced 2D descent game where the player jumps from a plane and must navigate through obstacles like other planes, hot air balloons, and environmental hazards to reach the ground as quickly as possible.  

**Twist:** The player can deploy a parachute to slow their fall and dodge obstacles more easily â€” but slowing down means a slower completion time.

## ðŸ“… Scope

This game will be built in **3 days** for the jam.  
Focus will be on:
- Core movement and obstacle mechanics
- Simple but clean art (abstract style if needed)
- Playable build by end of day 2
- Final polish and audio on day 3

## ðŸš€ Planned Features

- Infinite parachute use (possible limited parachute mode if time allows)
- Randomized obstacle layouts for replayability
- Increasing difficulty as player descends
- Basic scoring based on speed and collisions avoided
